# CS466 Web Store

This is a simple repo for version control and to keep us organized/make it easier to collaborate

I made a few example files in case you want to poke around/play with stuff. I stuck with php for everything as that's what was used in class

Once we get the main file structure down all the work should be done on a dev branch and then pull requested to main, which can then be merged onto main assuming there are no conflicts (project this simple, there shouldn't be)

I can go over things in more detail during our meeting, whenever we have it, if people need
